## 1️⃣ SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

**Definition:**  
SDLC is a structured process followed in software development to ensure quality and efficiency. It defines the phases that a software project goes through, from planning to maintenance.

**Phases of SDLC:**

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
   Collect client/business needs.  
   *Example:* A client wants an E-commerce website with login, product catalog, cart, and payment.

2. **System Design**  
   Convert requirements into design documents (UI design, database schema, architecture).  
   *Example:* Decide on front-end (React), back-end (Node.js), and database (MySQL).

3. **Implementation (Coding)**  
   Actual development starts based on design.  
   *Example:* Developers write login module, product listing, and checkout code.

4. **Testing**  
   Verify the software works as expected, find bugs, and fix them.  
   *Example:* Test login functionality with valid and invalid inputs.

5. **Deployment**  
   Deliver the system to the client or release it for users.  
   *Example:* Host the website on AWS.

6. **Maintenance**  
   Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements after release.  
   *Example:* Add a new payment gateway or fix UI issues after feedback.

## 2️⃣ Understanding the Waterfall Model

**Definition:**  
The Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC model, where the process flows step by step like a waterfall. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

**Phases of the Waterfall Model:**

1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis  
2. System Design  
3. Implementation (Coding)  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment  
6. Maintenance

**Characteristics:**
- Linear and sequential.
- No going back once a phase is complete.
- Best for projects where requirements are clear and fixed.

**🌍 Real-World Examples:**

- **Banking System Software:**  
  Fixed requirements like login, account details, money transfer, transaction history.  
  *Flow:* Gather requirements → Design database/UI → Code → Test → Deploy → Maintain.

- **Construction Projects (Non-Software Analogy):**  
  Build a house:  
  Requirement (2BHK) → Design (Blueprint) → Implementation (Construction) → Testing (Quality check) → Deployment (Handover keys) → Maintenance (Repairs).  
  *Note:* Once walls are built, you can’t suddenly change the foundation — similar to waterfall flow.

## 📝 Summary

- **SDLC:** Structured approach with phases — Requirement → Design → Coding → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.  
- **Waterfall Model:** Oldest SDLC model, sequential process, best for projects with fixed requirements like banking systems or construction projects.
